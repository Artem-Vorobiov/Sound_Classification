    "\n",
    "**Aggression detection** is a Point Anomaly.  This represents a sudden increase in volume compared to the typical sound levels. I would first try classification. This is because classification is a supervised technique, so I can train it using labeled data and orginize it in binary classification problem (aggressive vs non-aggressive).\n",
    "The disadvantage of classification techniques could be sensitivity to the choice of features. The most informative feature should be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **seizure detection** I would first try unsupervised technique because I need to identify patterns.\n",
    "It may be necessary to try several different clustering techniques and distance metrics to identify the optimal approach for seizure detection from pressure sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **car or bike ball bearing monitoring** through acceleration sensors, the technique I would first try is the Fourier transform. I can analyze the frequency of a signal. If the bearing has problem, then I will see unusual vibration on the graph. \n",
    "Combining spectral analysis with other techniques such as clustering or classification can help make detection of a problem more clear."
